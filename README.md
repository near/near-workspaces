near-workspaces
===============

Controlled, concurrent workspaces in local [NEAR Sandbox](https://github.com/near/sandbox) blockchains or on [NEAR TestNet](https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/networks). Fun, deterministic testing and powerful scripting for NEAR.

The same interface will be supported for multiple languages.

* TypeScript/JavaScript: [near/near-workspaces-js](https://github.com/near/near-workspaces-js)
* Rust: [near/near-workspaces-rs](https://github.com/near/near-workspaces-rs) (in early alpha; you can use workspaces-js with Rust projects for now)
