near-runner
===========

Write tests once, run them both on [NEAR TestNet](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/networks) and a controlled [NEAR Sandbox](https://github.com/near/sandbox) local environment.

The same testing interface will be supported for multiple languages.

* TypeScript/JavaScript: [near/runner-js](https://github.com/near/runner-js)
* Rust: [near/runner-rs](https://github.com/near/runner-rs) (in early alpha; you can use runner-js with Rust projects for now)
